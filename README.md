# Reveal.JS Slides Template

This template repository will serve as a springboard for using markdown (mdx) to generate a [RevealJS](https://revealjs.com/) slideshow within the [VS Code Text editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/) using the [VSCode Reveal extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=evilz.vscode-reveal). You can publish the slideshow on [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site) by [setting the publishing source](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) to the main branch at the '/docs' directory. 

The template will preconfigure the VSCode reveal extention to export the slide deck to the /docs directory so it will be published via GitHub pages.
